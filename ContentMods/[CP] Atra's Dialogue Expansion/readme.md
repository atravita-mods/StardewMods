Atra's Mundane Dialogue Expansion
=================================

This mod adds a lot of new dialogue, mostly focused on the mundane parts of small town life.

To be honest, I've always felt like there was part of Stardew's dialogue that just seemed...missing. Many of the characters felt just...not grounded to me. The employed NPCs never seemed to talk about their jobs. What **is** Demetrius's topic of research anyways? Why does Sebastian not feel like a programmer?

Additionally, dialogue tends to stagnant, and stagnant fairly quickly. There's only so many lines, and mostly they don't change over time.

I mostly wanted to fix both of these in this mod. So:
- Dialogue varies over time. A lot of this mod is on a **five year** cycle, and it's near impossible to see all of it.
- NPCs are more likely to reference each other and also reference background events.
- Generic lines got overhauled a bit and will tend to vary more.

Finally: this mod is designed to "play nice" with other dialogue mods and avoid overwriting completely as much as possible. You should be able to install this mod and get more dialogue - I use high priority keys but set my dialogue to only show up some of the time.

So get ready for NPCs talking about:
- Filing taxes!
- Strawberry DNA extractions
- Many, many "recently published papers."
- Small household repairs!
- Work and/or school.
- And, of course, rural electrification and telecommunication.

## Configuration 

* **EnableFor**: Lets you select which NPCs to enable this mod for.
* **IncreasedRealism**: These are primarily lines that deviate from game mechanics in favor of more real-life specifics. For example, if enabled, Marnie will talk about milking cows twice a day. This is not an adult content rating, unless your idea of adult content is, like, details about the finances of the dairy industry.
* **MapStrings**: Whether or not to edit certain map strings.
* **EnableGeneric**: Some lines are generic and apply to any spouse. Disable this if you don't want that.
* **EnableFestival**: Enables this mod's festival lines.
* **EnableMail**: Adds some variety to repeated mail.
* **EnableSpouseLocational**: This enables spouses off the farm to have dialogue, but overwrites all schedule dialogue for them.
* **ScheduleChanges**: Some NPCs have optional schedule variations. Choose which ones to enable.

## NPC-specific notes.

* **Abigail**: Abby's thing is that she's in college and she really doesn't like her major, which of course Pierre picked for her.
* **Alex**: Alex...Alex I focused more on his family. I don't think I took away from the hot jock vibe, I just tried to pull him towards a more realistic career plan.
* **Caroline**: Ah, long-suffering, used-to-be-fun Caroline! Gave her a more active role in the general store, as well as a lot more backstory.
* **Clint**: Clint I had the hardest time placing - after all, he's a traditional RPG blacksmith, which doesn't fit very well with approximately ~2005. So I'm leaning more artisan with him, he takes commissions. 
* **Demetrius**: Now has a research topic! He's primarily studying the interactions between fungi and trees and how that contributes to ecological diversity.
* **Elliott**: First, go install Realistic Writer Elliott. 
* **Emily**: Anyone else noticed that homegirl works 56 hours a week? Gus should be really giving you medical and retirement benefits, girl.
* **Evelyn**: I love, love Evelyn. I headcanon that she really did step in to help raise Penny after Pam....you know.
* **George**:
* **Gus**: Gus has such, such cozy vibes, doesn't he?
* **Haley**:
* **Harvey**:
* **Jodi**:
* **Kent**:
* **Leah**:
* **Lewis**: Lewis is interesting to me, since base game barely gives him any mayoral duties.
* **Marlon**: Well, he got a few extra festival lines, but I'm mostly skipping him. *If you have Stardew Valley Expanded installed even the festival lines won't show up.*
* **Marnie**: Marnie...honestly, I think canon Marnie's problem is that she doesn't seem to have...much, other than being Lewis's little secret. This mod mostly focuses on fleshing out Marnie-as-a-rancher and Marnie-as-an-aunt.
* **Maru**: Mostly wanted to focus her a little bit instead of making her a catch-all nerd girl. Her interests are in biomedical engineering, especially robotic limbs. Also, playing up her friendship with Penny.
* **Pam**: Kept it light in general with Pam since I've been working on a separate mod for her.
* **Penny**:
* **Pierre**:
* **Robin**:
* **Sam**:
* **Sandy**: Also mostly skipped - go download Immersive Sandy if you want more for her.
* **Sebastian**: The NPC that started this whole bloody project. Sebastian will now talk more about his job.
* **Shane**: Mostly skipped - seriously, just go install Immersive Shane if you want more of Shane, that mod is great.
* **Vincent**:
* **Willy**:
* **Wizard**: I'm gonna be honest, I couldn't really fit him into the theme of this mod. Plus the Wizard has no less than four separate mods focused on him alone, all with *wildly* differing fanons. So I'm skipping him. Go download any of the Romantic Rasmodius mods if you want more for him.

## Quick notes:
* **On profanity**: I was originally going to do a profanity filter. But when I started writing, I found that I didn't actually *want* to use swear words. I don't know. Stardew is just too wholesome for it.
* **On Stardew's magic**: None of the references to magic were removed, mundaneness was just the focus of this mod. I mostly ignored magical characters, they often had other mods that would cover them. *In general, other than a few places I found scientifically inaccurate, I left vanilla lines alone.*

## Compatibility
This mod should be compatible with most other mods, even other dialogue mods. I've tried to use dialogue keys that aren't commonly used. Additionally, each NPC can be enabled or disabled separately.

I do have a distinct characterization for some characters (see above for details) which may not match other mods.
