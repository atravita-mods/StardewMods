Contributions README
====================================

Most users should download the mod from the [Nexus page]<!--(https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/13049)-->. That said, if you'd like to contribute:

### Precaching:

The scheduler will pre-cache paths from certain locations. This is primarily used for locations where a lot of NPCs path through, like town centers.

For larger expansion mods, it may help to add your town center to this. The asset to target is `Mods/atravita/Rescheduler_Populate`, and the format is a `string->string` map between internal format and the search radius.

For example, this patch would add `Town`:

```js
{
    "Action": "EditData",
    "Target": "Mods/atravita/Rescheduler_Populate",
    "Entries": {
        "Town": "3"
    }
}
```

Note that the highest radius allowed is 4, and values of 2 or 3 work best. 

### Translations:

This mod uses SMAPI's i18n feature for translations. I'd love to get translations! Please see the wiki's guide [here](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Translations), and feel free to message me, contact me on Discord (@atravita#9505) or send me a pull request!

### Compiling from source:

3. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/atravita-mods/StardewMods).
4. Make sure you have [dotnet-5.0-sdk](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/5.0) installed.
5. If your copy of the game is not in the standard STEAM or Gog install locations, you may need to edit the csproj to point at it. [Instructions here](https://github.com/Pathoschild/SMAPI/blob/develop/docs/technical/mod-package.md#available-properties).

This project uses Pathos' multiplatform nuget, so it **should** build on any platform, although admittedly I've only tried it with Windows.
