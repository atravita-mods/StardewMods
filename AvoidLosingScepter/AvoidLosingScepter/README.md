Avoid Losing Specter
===========================

![Header image](docs/banner.jpg)

This mod prevents you from losing the Return Specter on death. Also prevents loss of the horse flute, and golden scythe.

# DEPRECATED: Absorbed by Stardew Valley 1.6. You should uninstall this mod.

## ~~Install~~

1. ~~Install the latest version of [SMAPI](https://smapi.io)~~.
2. ~~Download and install [AtraCore](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/12932)~~.
2. ~~Download this mod and unzip it into `Stardew Valley/Mods`.~~
3. ~~Run the game using SMAPI.~~

## Uninstall
Simply remove this mod from your Mods folder.

## Compatibility

* Works with Stardew Valley 1.5.6 on Linux/macOS/Windows. **Do not install for Stardew 1.6, which has absorbed this.**
* Works in single player, multiplayer, and split-screen mode. Should be fine if installed for one player only in multiplayer.
* Should be compatible with most other mods. (Special handling for [Moon Misadventures](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/10612), which has its own way of preventing you from losing certain things on death.)

For other mod authors: if you would like this mod to forbid the loss of an item, just attach the context tag `atravita_no_loss_on_death` on that item.
