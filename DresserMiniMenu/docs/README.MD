Documentation
=============

[‚Üê back to readme](../../README.md)

Most users should download the mod from the <!--[Nexus page](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/15557)-->. That said, if you'd like to contribute:

### Retextures
Retextures of this mod's icons should target `Mods/atravita/DresserMiniMenu/Icons`.

### Translations:

This mod uses SMAPI's i18n feature for translations. I'd love to get translations! Please see the wiki's guide [here](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Translations), and feel free to message me, contact me on Discord (@atravita#9505) or send me a pull request!

Additionally, the texture in `assets/icons.png` can be localized simply by creating a file with the name `assets/icons.{languageCode}.png`, ie `assets.icons.zh-CN.png` for Chinese.

### Compiling from source:

3. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/atravita-mods/StardewMods).
4. Make sure you have [dotnet-5.0-sdk](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/5.0) installed.
5. If your copy of the game is not in the standard STEAM or Gog install locations, you may need to edit the csproj to point at it. [Instructions here](https://github.com/Pathoschild/SMAPI/blob/develop/docs/technical/mod-package.md#available-properties).

This project uses Pathos' multiplatform nuget, so it **should** build on any platform, although admittedly I've only tried it with Windows.
