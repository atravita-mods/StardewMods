More Paint Masks
=================================

Adds in the buildings not included in vanilla into the [vanilla game's painting system](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Carpenter%27s_Shop#Painting). 

### FAQ
1. **Does this work with modded textures for buildings?** Basically no, the color masks are done manually. You would have to make the color masks yourself.
2. **Can you adjust the color masks a bit?** ... Maybe. It's pretty easy to do, btw, with just GIMP and the paintbucket tool.
3. **The slime hutch is cut off in the preview** ....Yeahhhh can't do anything about that without C#, sorry.
4. **The fish pond water colors are awkward** It's mixed with fish-specific colors by the game so it's really hard to get a good pure color here using just the painting system.
5. **What about the shipping bin?** Turns out only the base can be targeted by the base game painting system.
