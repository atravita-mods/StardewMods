    "clint-dance-no-emily": "Gosh, @, I've never been brave enough to ask someone to dance with me.",
    "clint-y2-dance": "I've been practicing this with my therapist, but now I'm not sure I can go through with asking someone to dance with me...",
    "clint-y3-dance": "I wonder if that refreshments table has any food on it still.",
    "demetrius-y2-dance": "Neither Robin nor I grew up here, so neither of us had to get up there and dance when we were young.",
    "demetrius-y3-dance": "I used to take Robin out for dances all the time, when we were young.",
    "demetrius-y3-dance-b": "Dancing is enjoyable enough, but in front of everyone?",
    "demetrius-y4-dance": "You can tell which type of pollinator a flower is trying to attract by just looking at the shape and color. Bee-pollinated flowers, for example, are usually bright blue or yellow.",

    "george-y2-dance": "Hrmph. Evelyn loves these flowers but they're horrid for my allergies...",
    "george-y3-dance": "Pushing my wheelchair across that tiny bridge wasn't easy, let me tell you that....and I still have to go back...",
    "george-y4-dance": "Gosh, @, I wish I could still take my dear Evelyn out dancing.",
    "gus-y2-dance": "I'm exceptionally proud of the jelly this year!",
    "gus-y3-dance": "Do try the rose hip tea, Evelyn and Caroline grew those flowers especially for it!",
    "gus-y4-dance": "We're almost at summer, @, it's almost the season for ice cream.",
    "haley-y2-dance.00": "Do you like my dress? Emily made it for me.",
    "haley-y2-dance.01": "She's so talented, isn't she?",

    "lewis-y2-dance-married": "Oh, @! Are you planning on joining the dance this year?",
    "lewis-y3-dance-married": "When you first came to this village, @, I wasn't sure you'd stay. But look at you now!",
    "lewis-y2-dance-unmarried": "Are you planning on dancing this year, @? Best hurry up and ask someone quickly!",
    "lewis-y3-dance-unmarried": "Is there anyone I'd want to dance with? Errr....no, and my bum knee means I can't, anyways...",
    "lewis-y3-dance-unmarried-better": "Is there anyone I'd want to dance with? Err, yes, but unfortunately I can't. My knee, you see.",
    "lewis-y4-dance-unmarried": "Plenty a young couple first danced here on this grass over the years.",
    "lewis-y4-dance-unmarried.00": "Of course, plenty of those young couples have since moved away...",
    "linus-y2-dance": "I'm just going to sneak in and grab a bite of food after the buffet clears out a bit.",
    "linus-y3-dance": "Anyone catch your eye, @?",

    "linus-y4-dance": "It's almost the end of spring. The weather'll start getting really hot soon...",
    "marlon-y2-dance": "You know, @, I used to enjoy a good dance or two, especially after a nice round of drinks...",
    "marlon-y3-dance": "Some say this dance is a celebration of the fertility of the valley.",
    "marlon-y4-dance": "Are you asking me if anyone caught my eye, @? Well, maybe....",

    "marnie-y2-dance": "Usually it doesn't bother me as much...but a day like this...I wish I...uh..I wish I wasn't single.",
    "marnie-y3-dance": "The flowers are lovely today, aren't they? Evelyn did a lovely job with them.",
    "marnie-y4-dance-better": "Sometimes, after the main dance is over, some of us older couples will dance a bit in the waning sunlight.",
    "marnie-y4-dance-knows": "Sometimes I wonder...will I ever find someone who will love me fully and completely?",
    "marnie-y4-dance": "I wonder...I wonder if anyone wants to dance with me?",
    "maru-y2-dance.00": "All right, let's get this awkward dance over with.",
    "maru-y2-dance.01": "At least the food is as good as always.",
    "maru-y3-dance.00": "*sigh*. It's almost the end of strawberry season.",
    "maru-y1-dance-spouse.00": "Gosh, this dance is going to be as awkward as ever.",
    "maru-y1-dance-spouse.01": "Everyone does look quite nice though.",
    "maru-y2-dance-spouse": "How do I look, my dear? I don't get a good opportunity to wear a dress often...",
    "pam-y2-dance": "That red jelly...that reminds me of something my Pappy used to make for us...",
    "penny-y2-dance.00": "I've been practicing this dance for weeks.",
    "penny-y2-dance.01": "I really don't want to go up there and embarrass myself.",

    "penny-y2-dance-spouse.00": "When I was single, I was always so terrified no one would ask me to dance.",
    "penny-y2-dance-spouse.01": "Thankfully, now I've got you!",
    "robin-y2-dance": "Sebastian's not much of a dancer, I wonder if he'll dance with someone this year.",
    "robin-y3-dance": "I wonder if I can talk Demetrius into dancing with me...",
    "robin-y4-dance": "Demetrius and I try to go out dancing every Friday evening. Sometimes I have to go build something, but our date nights are very important to us.",
    "robin-y2-dance-sebastian-married": "I'm glad that Sebastian's settled down now.",
    "robin-y2-dance-sebastian-married.00": "Plus, there's a lot less pressure on him to dance now that he's taken!",

    "sam-y2-dance.01": "Achoo!",
    "sam-y1-dance-spouse": "Hey, @, you look nice today.",
    "sam-y2-dance-spouse.00": "Gosh, these flowers are really triggering my allergies.",

    "gus-pre-winter-star.0": "It's time for me to make our famous giant candy canes!",
    "gus-pre-winter-star.1": "I've got a nice roast for this year's winter star, you're gonna love it.",
    "gus-pre-winter-star.2": "Making the food for our festivals is something I quite enjoy.#$b#Of course, the money helps too!",

    "gus-y2-xmas.00": "Ah, candy making, I don't get a good opportunity to make candy most days.",
    "gus-y2-xmas.01": "To make candy canes, we have to heat up sugar syrup quite hot.",
    "gus-y2-xmas.02": "Next, we have to mix in the flavors and colors, and the white cane needs to be pulled to incorporate air.",
    "gus-y2-xmas.03": "The air is what makes the cane opaque, see?",
    "gus-y2-xmas.04": "We only have a short time to shape the candy canes before they cool too much.",
    "gus-y2-xmas.05": "It's a lot of work, but it's worth it!",
    "gus-y3.xmas.00": "When making candy canes, it's important to use an inverted sugar syrup in addition to your cane sugar.",
    "gus-y3.xmas.01": "This prevents the sugar from crystallizing.",
    "gus-y3.xmas.02": "It's also important to avoid adding your flavorings while the sugar is too hot.",
    "gus-y3.xmas.03": "Or else you burn your flavorings.",

    "jodi-xmas-pre.03": "Sam has been asking me for new video games, and Vincent new toys, but I'm not sure how we're supposed to afford all this.$s#$b#I guess we'll manage.", 
    "jodi-y2-xmas": "Mmmm. Gus makes a great eggnog, doesn't he? *hic*",
    "jodi-y3-xmas": "I've got my husband and my kids with me, who could ask for anything better?",
    "jodi-y4-xmas": "Today can be a cheat day in the diet.",

    "leah-y2-xmas.01": "It's a simple life, but it's the one I want.",
    "leah-y3-xmas": "I wonder...would there be a way to carve those candy canes into interesting shapes? Might give it a try next year.",
    "leah-y2-xmas-spouse-kids": "Our family is all I need, @. Our farm, our kids, you, me, I'm so proud of what we've built together.",
    "leah-y2-xmas-spouse": "I appreciate you, @, and the life we've built.",
    "leah-y3-xmas-spouse": "I'm so glad both you and I decided to move here, @. I can't imagine our life any other way.",
    "leo-y2-xmas": "Where I come from, it doesn't get cold like this.",
    "leo-y3-xmas": "I wish I could have my parrot family here with me too.",
    "leo-y4-xmas": "@, I'm glad you and Linus accept me.",
    "leo-y4-xmas.00": "When I first moved here, I thought no one would.",
    "lewis-y2-xmas": "The legend of the Winter Star is quite important to our little town.",
