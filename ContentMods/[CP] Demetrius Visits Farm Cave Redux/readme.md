Demetrius Visits Farm Cave Redux
=================================

Makes Demetrius visit his little experiment in the farm cave sometimes. Also gives him 80+ lines of dialogue to use, consisting mostly of science facts, dad jokes, and the occasional rant about Reviewer 2.

Demetrius will either come visit once per week or once per month, depending on settings. You can restrict him to only coming on days that are winter or raining, when otherwise he'd be indoors all day. If you have [Non Destructive NPCs](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/5176) installed, he'll leave at 4PM. Otherwise, he'll be there all day. This is because the default Stardew scheduler will not prevent NPCs from walking straight through and breaking the mushroom boxes, so if you don't have Non Destructive NPCs installed, he won't be allowed to move around.

## Configuration 

* **DemetriusVisitDay**: Select which day Demetrius comes to the farm cave. If you select a day of week, he comes once per week. If you select a specific day, he comes once per month. Specific schedules (like his night market schedule or his hospital visit) will still take priority though. (Custom NPC Exclusions is used to prevent him from trying to go to Ginger Island.)
* **OnlyIfRainingOrWinter**: Will limit Demetrius to only visiting during the winter or during days where it's raining, when he'd stay inside otherwise. (Most of his other schedules have him wandering around town or studying the river in the mountains.)
* **OverrideUnlock**: Demetrius should start visiting after the farm cave is unlocked, but if that doesn't work for some reason, set this to true.
* **EnableDialogue**: Enables the dialogue this mod adds. 
* **XPosition/YPosition**: Sets the location Demetrius should stand in.
* **XWarp/YWarp**: Sets the location Demetrius should leave the farm cave from. This should be set one square away from the actual exit. You probably don't need to change this.
