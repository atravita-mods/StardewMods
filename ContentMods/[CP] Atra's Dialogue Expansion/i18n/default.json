    "gus-y2-xmas.00": "Ah, candy making, I don't get a good opportunity to make candy most days.",
    "gus-y2-xmas.01": "To make candy canes, we have to heat up sugar syrup quite hot.",
    "gus-y2-xmas.02": "Next, we have to mix in the flavors and colors, and the white cane needs to be pulled to incorporate air.",
    "gus-y2-xmas.03": "The air is what makes the cane opaque, see?",
    "gus-y2-xmas.04": "We only have a short time to shape the candy canes before they cool too much.",
    "gus-y2-xmas.05": "It's a lot of work, but it's worth it!",
    "gus-y3.xmas.00": "When making candy canes, it's important to use an inverted sugar syrup in addition to your cane sugar.",
    "gus-y3.xmas.01": "This prevents the sugar from crystallizing.",
    "gus-y3.xmas.02": "It's also important to avoid adding your flavorings while the sugar is too hot.",
    "gus-y3.xmas.03": "Or else you burn your flavorings.",

    "leah-y2-xmas.00": "Sometimes, I wonder just how I managed to get this life.",
    "leah-y2-xmas.01": "It's a simple life, but it's the one I want.",
    "leah-y3-xmas": "I wonder...would there be a way to carve those candy canes into interesting shapes? Might give it a try next year.",
    "leah-y2-xmas-spouse-kids": "Our family is all I need, @. Our farm, our kids, you, me, I'm so proud of what we've built together.",
    "leah-y2-xmas-spouse": "I appreciate you, @, and the life we've built.",
    "leah-y3-xmas-spouse": "I'm so glad both you and I decided to move here, @. I can't imagine our life any other way.",
    "leo-y2-xmas": "Where I come from, it doesn't get cold like this.",
    "leo-y3-xmas": "I wish I could have my parrot family here with me too.",
    "leo-y4-xmas": "@, I'm glad you and Linus accept me.",
