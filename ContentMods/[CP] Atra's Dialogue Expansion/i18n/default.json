    "lewis-cc-vault.winter.1": "I'm glad that this town is growing again.",
    "lewis-cc-vault.spring.2": "So, @, what are you planning on planting this spring?",
    "lewis-cc-vault.summer.2": "We used to have many more farmers in this valley. But our soil isn't the best, and with the mines so close, it became harder to sell food produced in this valley.#$b#I guess the mine closure did have some upsides.",
    "lewis-cc-value.fall.2": "Pelican Town used to be a major mining town. We supplied Grampleton's steel mills for decades.#$b#Sadly, those steel mills have been closed for a long time, too. Off-shoring.",

    "lewis-cc-vault.winter.4": "Sometimes I wonder if it'd just be better to let Grampleton or Zuzu absorb us.",

    "lewis-cc-vault.summer.0": "One of the nice things about Pelican Town is that our property costs are relatively low, so our cost of living isn't too high.",

    "lewis-cc-filing.spring.0": "Well, @, I'm glad the economy is finally on the upswing.",
    "lewis-cc-filing.summer.0": "I'm glad we have a doctor here, @. Most towns our size can't sustain a doctor's practice.#$b#Of course, government grants really help here.",

    "lewis-cc-desk.fall.0": "We don't need any bureaucrats telling us what to do.$s#$b#Sometimes, I do regret being one of those bureaucrats in a my past career.#$b#It was too easy to get lost in the numbers and lose sight of the people.",
    "lewis-cc-desk.winter.0": "You'd think there'd be a lot less for me to do during winter, but everything seems to want to break in these cold months.#$b#Also doesn't help that it's too cold to fix potholes correctly.",

    "lewis-cc-bulletin.fall.1": "Maybe I've been taking the small town community spirit for granted...",
    "lewis-cc-bulletin.winter.1": "@, my focus has mostly been on the economic health of this town, not the social health. But maybe I should focus more on building up the community...",

    "lewis-cc-bulletin.spring.3": "@, I'm trying to cut taxes as much as I can. I know with the economy the way it is, businesspeople like Marnie really do need as much help as we can give.",

    "penny-y2-egg-spouse": "*sigh*, I really should do a better job of trying to keep in touch with Maru. It's so easy to become wrapped up in farm life...",
    "penny-y3-egg-spouse.00": "Oh, I used to love the egg salad my grandmother made...",
    "penny-y3-egg-spouse.01": "Sorry, @, I couldn't help but be reminded of her.",
    "pierre-y3-egg": "I don't think there are any eggs back here. So there's no reason for you to be here.", // there should be an egg back there, btw.
    "pierre-y4-egg.00": "Look, I don't know why you want to come back here, but can you please stay out of my way?",

    "abby-y2-dance.00": "@, you think we could get rid of this festival? I don't think anyone likes the dance.",
    "abby-y1-dance-spouse": "Ugh, @, dance with me? That way I won't feel so awkward.",
    "alex-y2-dance.00": "Everyone looks fantastic today.",
    "alex-y1-dance-spouse": "You look great as always, my love. Dance with me?",
    "alex-y2-dance-spouse": "Wanna dance? Or do you want to just get out of here?",
    "caroline-y2-dance.00": "Maybe this year I'll get Pierre to dance with me...",
    "clint-dance-no-emily": "Gosh, @, I've never been brave enough to ask someone to dance with me.",
    "clint-y2-dance": "I've been practicing this with my therapist, but now I'm not sure I can go through with asking someone to dance with me...",
    "clint-y3-dance": "I wonder if that refreshments table has any food on it still.",
    "demetrius-y2-dance": "I used to take Robin out for dances all the time, when we were young.",
    "demetrius-y3-dance": "Neither Robin nor I grew up here, so sometimes I wonder what it'd be like to dance with her at this festival...",
    "demetrius-y4-dance": "You can tell which type of pollinator a flower is trying to attract by just looking at the shape and color. Bee-pollinated flowers, for example, are usually bright blue or yellow.",
    "elliott-y2-dance.00": "I do enjoy a good dance every now and then.",
    "elliott-y2-dance.01": "Perhaps we should organize dances more often?",

    "emily-y1-dance-spouse": "Gus and I have been working on the food for days! Isn't it amazing?",
    "emily-y2-dance-spouse": "I do enjoy a good opportunity to wear a beautiful dress. My @, will you dance with me today?",
    "evelyn-y2-dance": "Our little town used to be famous for its flowers. Used to be our biggest export.",
    "evelyn-y3-dance": "I do really enjoy putting together the flower arrangements every year. Aren't these lovely?",
    "evelyn-y4-dance": "I remember many years ago, when Pam and Caroline and Marnie were the ones dancing...Pam used to be quite good looking in her youth, you know.",
    "george-y2-dance": "Hrmph. Evelyn loves these flowers but they're horrid for my allergies...",
    "george-y3-dance": "Pushing my wheelchair across that tiny bridge wasn't easy, let me tell you that....and I still have to go back...",
    "george-y4-dance": "Gosh, @, I wish I could still take my dear Evelyn out dancing.",
    "gus-y2-dance": "I'm exceptionally proud of the jelly this year!",
    "gus-y3-dance": "Do try the rose hip tea, Evelyn and Caroline grew those flowers especially for it!",
    "gus-y4-dance": "We're almost at summer, @, it's almost the season for ice cream.",
    "haley-y2-dance.00": "Do you like my dress? Emily made it for me.",
    "haley-y2-dance.01": "She's so talented, isn't she?",
    "haley-y1-dance-spouse": "We make a striking pair, don't we? Come, @, come dance with me.",
    "haley-y2-dance-spouse": "I'll never turn down the chance to put on a pretty dress and dance a bit. Come dance with me, @?",
    "harvey-y2-dance.00": "I wonder what's in that red jelly?",
    "harvey-y2-dance.01": "It tastes excellent, but that's...quite a vibrant red color....",
    "harvey-y1-dance-spouse": "My love, you look dashing today. Dance with me?",
    "harvey-y2-dance-spouse": "@, I'm so glad I've got you. Dance with me today?",
    "jas-y2-dance": "My collar itches.",
    "jas-y3-dance": "Look at my dress, {{title}} @! Isn't it pretty?",
    "jas-y4-dance": "I wanna dance with you guys!",
    "jodi-y2-dance": "Kent used to take me out dancing on Friday nights, back before we had children.",
    "jodi-y3-dance": "I wonder who Sam will dance with this year?",
    "jodi-y3-dance-sam-married": "Gosh, I didn't expect Sam to find someone so fast, but I'm glad he did.",
    "jodi-y3-dance-sam-married.00": "Marriage has been good for him, I think.",
    "jodi-y4-dance": "Kent, do you think we could dance this year?",

    // Dance of the Moonlight Jellies
    "abby-y2-jellies": "Man, I'm not looking forward to school starting again",

    "alex-y1-jellies-spouse": "Man, I wish I remembered to eat before this festival.",
    "caroline-y2-jellies": "*Yawns*. Gosh, @, I'm getting old. I just want to go to sleep.",
    "clint-y2-jellies": "Glad it's gonna cool off soon, will make working the forge less miserable.",

    "demetrius-summer-end.2": "Ah, it's nearly the end of summer, I've got to start preparing for the new semester.",
    "demetrius-summer-end.3": "School year's about to begin, @. To be honest, I'm glad I don't have to teach anymore...",
    "demetrius-summer-end.4": "I'd love to go visit the deeps of the ocean some day, but money is always an issue...$s",
    "demetrius-summer-end.0": "Jellyfish only have two tissues layers, and they mostly just drift along with the currents.",
    "demetrius-jellies-pre.01": "The town gathers to celebrate the arrival of the 'Moonlight Jellies' every year, but that's really not how jellyfish work.",
    "demetrius-jellies-pre.02": "Jellies don't really control where they go, they drift along with the currents, trapping anything they can get with their tentacles.",
    "demetrius-y1-jellies": "Isn't it curious, how the currents change to bring us these jellyfish every year?",
    "demetrius-y2-jellies.01": "The 'Moonlight Jelly' rises in the water column each day near nightfall, and descends at sunrise.",
    "demetrius-y2-jellies.02": "This is known as the Diel vertical migration.",
    "demetrius-y3-jellies": "Bioluminescence is quite common among the denizens of the sea, actually. But these jellies are quite pretty.",
    "elliott-y2-jellies": "Isn't this romantic, @? This is exactly the type of place I'd pick for a setting for a romance.",
    "elliott-y3-jellies": "Between you and I, @, I'd love to turn in early tonight but there's just too much commotion on this beach for that.",
    "elliott-y1-jellies-spouse": "Isn't this romantic, my dear @? Imagine, us, the sea, a nice bottle of Stardew red...",
    "emily-y2-jellies.01": "I was watching a documentary the other day about all the interesting-looking creatures of the depths of the ocean.",
    "emily-y2-jellies.02": "It's amazing, right, what these organisms have to do to survive at such pressure and with no light.",
    "emily-y2-jellies-spouse": "Look at how ethereal those jellies look, darling! Maybe I should make a dress like that...",
    "evelyn-y2-jellies.01": "George took me on a date to the Zuzu City Aquarium once.",
    "evelyn-y2-jellies.02": "All the sea creatures were beautiful, of course, but the moon jellies were majestic.", // "moon jellies" here is intentional, that's the real-life species.
    "george-y2-jellies": "Man, I wish my wheelchair worked better on this sand...",
    "gus-y2-jellies": "I offered to cater this festival as well but Mayor Lewis said we didn't have the budget for that.",
    "haley-y2-jellies.01": "Gosh, @, aren't these moonlight jellies beautiful?",
    "haley-y2-jellies.02": "I'd love to own a dress as ethereal as that...",
    "haley-y2-jellies-spouse": "Gosh, is it the end of summer already, @? We've got to get ready for fall.",
    "harvey-y2-jellies": "Those moonlight jellies are beautiful, but you wouldn't want to get into the water with them. They sting quite a bit.",
    "harvey-y2-jellies-spouse": "It's the end of summer...@, I won't be missing this heat.",
    "jas-y2-jellies": "Oh, look, @, I think I see a tiny one!",
    "jodi-y2-jellies": "That jelly....do you think that jelly might be a rare green one?",
    "kent-y2-jellies": "I don't know about you, but I'm glad it's nearly the end of this forsaken heat.",
    "kent-y1-jellies-high-hearts": "Hey, @. You looking forward to the harvest season?",
    "leah-y2-jellies": "And yet another summer gone. Man, @, time seems to fly by sometimes, doesn't it?",
    "leah-y2-jellies-spouse": "Wow, @, yet another summer gone. You ready for fall?",
    "leo-y2-jellies": "Mr. Demetrius says the Moonlight jellies prefer warmer waters. That's why they like the island too.",
    "lewis-y2-jellies": "I'm ready to light the candle-boat any time, @. Just gotta make sure everyone who wants to come is here.",
    "linus-y1-jellies": "Oh, @, these jellies can travel all the way here from Ginger Island. Just imagine, these little creatures drifting on the ocean currents for so far...", // replacement Y1 line when the island is unlocked.
    "linus-y2-jellies": "The earth is wonderful to us, isn't she? So much beauty she provides us.",
    "marnie-y2-jellies": "I wonder if I can get Mayor Lewis to fix up the docks a little bit.",
    "maru-y2-jellies.00": "Dad talked my ear off about siphonophores the entire time we were walking down here.",
    "maru-y2-jellies.01": "Siphonophores aren't even jellyfish, but it's hard to get him to stop once he's started.",
    "maru-y1-jellies-spouse": "Ah, it's almost fall, @. I can feel the chill in the air tonight.",
    "pam-y2-jellies": "I forgot there wasn't food at this festival and now I'm hungry.",
    "penny-y1-jellies-spouse": "It's so peaceful out here at night, isn't it, @? Maybe I should come out here to read more often.",
    "penny-y2-jellies.00": "It's getting chilly out. I can feel fall coming around the corner...",
    "penny-y2-jellies.01": "Fall really isn't my favorite season, @.",
    "pierre-y2-jellies": "So, @, what are you planning on planting tomorrow?",
    "robin-y2-jellies": "It's time to say goodbye to summer, I guess.",
    "robin-y3-jellies": "Demetrius doesn't usually study sea life, but he sure can talk your ear off about anything if he wants.",
    "sam-y2-jellies.00": "I asked Dr. Harvey. Apparently, these jellyfish really hurt if you touch one.",
    "sam-y2-jellies.01": "Well, I'm glad I didn't push Sebastian in...",
    "sam-y1-jellies-spouse": "Man, I really should visit Sebastian and Abigail more often, shouldn't I?",
    "sebastian-y2-jellies.00": "It's so nice and quiet, isn't it, @?",
    "sebastian-y2-jellies.01": "Maybe a little too quiet...",
    "sebastian-y1-jellies-spouse": "The dock's so peaceful at night. Maybe I should come out here more often?",
    "shane-y2-jellies.00": "This festival's just so peaceful, @, isn't it?",
    "shane-y2-jellies.01": "Feel like it'd easily be my favorite festival, if there was just food.",
    "shane-y1-jellies-spouse.00": "Every year, those jellies come back. I wonder how long they've been doing this for?",
    "shane-y1-jellies-spouse.01": "I wonder how many years they'll continue coming back after we're gone?",
    "vincent-y2-jellies": "I wanna go back inside. I'm so chilly.",
    "willy-y1-jellies": "Many fish use light to lure prey to them.",

    "elliott-y2-halloween.00": "Gosh, fall's almost over, and I feel like I've barely worked on my manuscript all season...",
    "elliott-y2-halloween.01": "The only thing scarier than that maze is writer's block.",

    "evelyn-y2-halloween": "This festival...well, I'm glad the young ones like it, but do we need to have skeletons in town?",
    "evelyn-y3-halloween": "That maze...it scares me more than I should admit...",
    "george-y2-halloween": "Well, I won't say no to free crab cakes.",
