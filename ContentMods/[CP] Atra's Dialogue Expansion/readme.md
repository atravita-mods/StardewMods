Atra's Mundane Dialogue Expansion
=================================

This mod adds a lot of new dialogue, mostly focused on the mundane parts of small town life.

To be honest, I've always felt like there was part of Stardew's dialogue that just seemed...missing. Many of the characters felt just...not grounded to me. The employed NPCs never seemed to talk about their jobs. What **is** Demetrius's topic of research anyways? Why does Sebastian not feel like a programmer?

Additionally, dialogue tends to stagnant, and stagnant fairly quickly. There's only so many lines, and mostly they don't change over time.

I mostly wanted to fix both of these in this mod. So:
- Dialogue varies over time. A lot of this mod is on a **five year** cycle, and it's near impossible to see all of it.
- NPCs are more likely to reference each other and also reference background events.
- Generic lines got overhauled a bit and will tend to vary more.

Finally: this mod is designed to "play nice" with other dialogue mods and avoid overwriting completely as much as possible. You should be able to install this mod and get more dialogue - I use high priority keys but set my dialogue to only show up some of the time.

So get ready for NPCs talking about:
- Filing taxes!
- Strawberry DNA extractions
- Many, many "recently published papers."
- Small household repairs!
- Work and/or school.
- And, of course, rural electrification and telecommunication.

## Configuration 

* **EnableFor**: Lets you select which NPCs to enable this mod for.
* **IncreasedRealism**: These are primarily lines that deviate from game mechanics in favor of more real-life specifics. For example, if enabled, Marnie will talk about milking cows twice a day. This is not an adult content rating, unless your idea of adult content is, like, details about the finances of the dairy industry.
* **MapStrings**: Whether or not to edit certain map strings.
* **EnableGeneric**: Some lines are generic and apply to any spouse. Disable this if you don't want that.
* **EnableFestival**: Enables this mod's festival lines.
* **EnableMail**: Adds some variety to repeated mail.
* **EnableSpouseLocational**: This enables spouses off the farm to have dialogue, but overwrites all schedule dialogue for them.
* **ScheduleChanges**: Some NPCs have optional schedule variations. Choose which ones to enable.

## NPC-specific notes.

* **Abigail**: Abby's thing is that she's in college and she really doesn't like her major, which of course Pierre picked for her.
* **Alex**: 
* **Caroline**: Ah, long-suffering, used-to-be-fun Caroline! Gave her a more active role in the general store, as well as a lot more backstory.
* **Clint**: Clint I had the hardest time placing - after all, he's a traditional RPG blacksmith, which doesn't fit very well with approximately ~2005. So I'm leaning more artisan with him, he takes commissions. 
* **Demetrius**: Now has a research topic! He's primarily studying the interactions between fungi and trees and how that contributes to ecological diversity.
* **Elliott**:
* **Emily**: Anyone else noticed that homegirl works 56 hours a week? Gus should be really giving you medical and retirement benefits, girl.
* **Evelyn**: I love, love Evelyn. I headcanon that she really did step in to help raise Penny after Pam....you know.
* **George**:
* **Gus**: Gus has such, such cozy vibes, doesn't he?
* **Haley**:
* **Harvey**:
* **Jodi**:
* **Kent**:
* **Leah**:
* **Lewis**:
* **Marnie**: 
* **Maru**: Mostly wanted to focus her a little bit instead of making her a catch-all nerd girl. Her interests are in biomedical engineering, especially robotic limbs. Also, playing up her friendship with Penny.
* **Pam**: Kept it light in general with Pam since I've been working on a separate mod for her.
* **Penny**:
* **Pierre**:
* **Robin**:
* **Sam**:
* **Sandy**:
* **Sebastian**: The NPC that started this whole bloody project. Sebastian will now talk more about his job.
* **Shane**: Mostly skipped - seriously, just go install Immersive Shane if you want more of Shane, that mod is great.
* **Vincent**:
* **Willy**:

## Compatibility
This mod should be compatible with most other mods, even other dialogue mods. I've tried to use dialogue keys that aren't commonly used. Additionally, each NPC can be enabled or disabled separately.
