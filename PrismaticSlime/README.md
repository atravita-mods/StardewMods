Prismatic Slime
=================================

![Header image](docs/prismatic.gif)

Makes that prismatic slime not a one-time encounter. Lets you raise them in the slime hutch. Gives the Prismatic Jelly a few more usages.

This is my Pride 2022 mod. But wait, atra, you may say, it's like...2023? And I say: yes. I know. I'm very late.
