    "demetrius.Bats.Spring.02": "Bats, like birds, live much much longer than you'd expect, given their size. They can live up to thirty years!",
    "demetrius.Bats.Spring.03": "Bat guano makes for excellent fertilizer. Before the invention of chemical fertilizers, countries would literally export bat poop!",

    "demetrius.Bats.Spring.05": "So much work to do...$s",

    "demetrius.Bats.Summer.00": "I'm glad you've decided to host some bats here, @. Loss of habitat is one of the main things threatening bats these days.#$b#It's only a small thing but small things add up.",
    "demetrius.Bats.Summer.01": "Fruit bats are major pollinators, too! Among other things, they'll pollinate mango and banana trees.",
    "demetrius.Bats.Summer.02": "Because bats use echolocation to navigate, bat-pollinated flowers are usually pale. They sometimes have acoustic features, too, to make them more obvious.",
    "demetrius.Bats.Summer.03": "To get through cold winters, most bats hibernate, although some migrate.",
    "demetrius.Bats.Summer.04": "The wings of bats are homologous to our hands. In fact, that their scientific name - chiroptera - translates to 'hand wing'.",
    "demetrius.Bats.Summer.05": "Bats have special adaptations that let them roost upside down without all their blood flowing to their head.$h",
    "demetrius.Bats.Summer.06": "Compared to birds, bats have much more flexible wings. That's because their wings are homologous to our hands, not our arms.",

    "demetrius.Bats.Fall.04": "Because they tend to be nocturnal, bats use echolocation to navigate! Some bats can even change their calls to account for Doppler shift!#$b#Of course, they have perfectly serviceable vision as well, the idiom 'blind as a bat' doesn't really fit.#$b#In fact, bats that don't echolocate have vision far exceeding ours.",

    "demetrius.Bats.Winter.04": "Apparently, bats can eavesdrop on other bats.#$b#One of the ways migratory bats find good homes at the end of their migrations is by eavesdropping on the locals.",
    "demetrius.Bats.Winter.05": "Some bats, the ones that tend to drink nectar, can even see ultraviolet light! Others have perfectly serviceable cone cells.#$b#The idiom 'blind as a bat' really doesn't make much sense, doesn't it?",
    "demetrius.Bats.Winter.06": "Not every bat echolocates. Most of the larger ones done, for example. We think that might be because their echolocation is tied heavily to the rate they flap their wings, so it's less efficient for big bats.",
    "demetrius.Bats.Winter.07": "Have you ever considered, @, how demanding flight really is, physiologically?#$b#A bat's heart can beat over a thousand times per minute in flight, but it slows to twelve beats per minute when they're hibernating.#$b#In contrast, yours and mine go between about seventy to about two hundred beats per minute.",
    "demetrius.Bats.Winter.08": "I've been attaching little radio transmitters to these bats, so we can track their movements.$h#$b#These little transmitters have certainly gotten so much smaller over the last few years, letting us use them with the bats.$h",
    "demetrius.Bats.Winter.09": "Did you know, @, some bats migrate hundreds or even thousands of miles in winter? We're not quite sure what causes a bat to decide to migrate and how they choose their destination.",

    "demetrius.Mushrooms.Spring.05": "Mushrooms are actually far more closely related to us than they are to plants!",
    "demetrius.Mushrooms.Spring.06": "If you go out foraging, you can often find edible mushrooms. Just be careful in your identification.",
    "demetrius.Mushrooms.Spring.07": "Some species of ants actually farm fungi. Leafcutter ants, for example, bring back cuttings of leaves to feed a fungus they grow in their nests.",

    "demetrius.Mushrooms.Summer.03": "Mushrooms use chitin as their structural protein. It's the same protein that forms the exoskeletons of insects.",
